# Sizi's Mod Pack
A collection of Jokers and other stuff based off ideas tossed around with some friends for Balatro 

# V1.0
- Adds 50 new Jokers with varying degrees of balance
- 9 new custom Decks to try out
  
#Disclaimer:
-----------------------
This mod is incompatible with Talisman due to some stuff relating to calculating money earned 
on some jokers in this mod. That being said, I cannot account for this mod working great with other mods so 
I don't know how well I can fix issues with mod compatibility so i'd advise to not report any issues pertaining to such

Here is also a quick tutorial on how to Install mods to speed up the process:
1. Install the Lovely injector here: https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector
2. Download Steamodded and add it to your %AppData%Roaming\Balatro\mods folder https://github.com/Steamodded/smods
3. Download this mod and put it inside of the mods folder from the previous step

With all that said, I hope you enjoy this mod. It took a lot of trial and error to finish, and expect more updates with content coming
within the next few months or so. And thanks to all some of my friends for providing many joker ideas, y'all rock!
